        ## **Collaborative Perception (CP) for Autonomous Driving**
        - **CP System Design**: CP can overcome the limitations of single-agent perception systems, such as occlusion and sensing range, by leveraging the information from multiple vehicles.
        - **Security Issues in CP**: As CP needs to leverage the information from other vehicles, it expands the system's attack surface. Therefore, designing defense method is curial for secure CP.
  

        ## **Large Language Models (LLMs)**
        - **Multi-Agent LLM Systems for Autonomous Driving**: Similar as CP, not only multi-agent perception but also multi-agent collaborative decision-making is important for next-generation autonomous driving. Here, LLM is leveraged as a powerful tool to build the multi-agent collaborative decision-making systems.
        - **LLM Task Adaptation**: Adapting pre-trained LLMs to specific tasks, such as collaborative decision-making, better and more efficiently.
